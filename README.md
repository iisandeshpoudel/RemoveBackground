In WordPress 2024, we needed to create a transparent PNG with background removed, so that the image of a person can be lasered into Token of Love. I created on the spot this very simple yet quick Flask App in Docker container image to later deploy it to web.

## Run it

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
